Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

Members table (member_id PK, member_name, member_address)
Dinner table (dinner_id PK, date, venue_code, venue_description) 
Food table (food_code PK, food_description)

Junction tables : 
Reservation table (member_id FK, dinner_id FK)
Dinner_food table (dinner_id FK, food_code FK)

// in our case all venues are unique per dinner_id, in rael life venues will start to repeat thus not unique
// in this case we should create Venues table (venue_code PK, venue_description) and add venue code as FK in Dinner table
